00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.450
Brian Lerner: Hey, Pranav! How's it going.

2
00:00:05.323 --> 00:00:08.969
Pranav Manjunath: It's going on. Well, man, it's going on well, how are you? How's your day?

3
00:00:09.924 --> 00:00:13.570
Brian Lerner: Day was good tired, you know.

4
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.030
Brian Lerner: Just have to think a lot about the Irb.

5
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.020
Brian Lerner: so just feel a little tired. But you know that's just in the life of a Phd. Student.

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.860
Pranav Manjunath: Oh, man,

7
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:31.780
Pranav Manjunath: I've I've had the worst experience ever with with the Irb process, and it's just it's a.

8
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.499
Brian Lerner: What happened like but like for you, like, what? What are you feeling about? It?

9
00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.389
Pranav Manjunath: Yeah, it's just it's just such a hassle. Because here we are trying to.

10
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.399
Pranav Manjunath: I don't know, like, do research. But then

11
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:52.929
Pranav Manjunath: you have all of these, all of these extra problems that come in the way and cannot do what you want to do. It's sometimes so frustrating to do. Have to like

12
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.759
Pranav Manjunath: go through all the process, and for every project we want to work on, it's just such a pain. I know.

13
00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:03.310
Brian Lerner: I know the worst, but you know

14
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.090
Brian Lerner: it's it's just what it's like to be a Phd student. And you know hmm!

15
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.359
Brian Lerner: You know I was thinking about

16
00:01:13.545 --> 00:01:18.250
Brian Lerner: you know. Never actually. Hmm, yeah, I

17
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:28.699
Brian Lerner: I I think now, maybe let's talk about what? What is it like to be a Phd student. What what is it? You know? What besides doing, Irbs? What does that intend.

18
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.929
Pranav Manjunath: Oh, dude! Yeah, no, for sure. I think I mean, I've

19
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:43.359
Pranav Manjunath: I actually love the process. I I mean, I came straight from undergrad master's. And then, Pts, I never worked ever in my life. It was just like straight, straight school, my entire life.

20
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.619
Pranav Manjunath: And so it definitely needs a different mindset like. It's

21
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:57.220
Pranav Manjunath: it's not something we're like. I was just talking to a friend about this lately, and we're talking about the idea of like how

22
00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.579
Pranav Manjunath: in the Phd. Program is so much as like

23
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:20.720
Pranav Manjunath: so much is open just out there for you to explore, usually like throughout my whole undergrad, or like in my master's. It was so like defined like, this is what you should finish at this date. Next assignment is due on this day. It's so well defined. But, like here you walk, you walk into research, and it's like, Oh, like this is cool. I don't know. How do you feel about that? I'm curious. How's your experience? Like the Phd. Process.

24
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.805
Brian Lerner: Do you see these bags under my eyes? I didn't have when I started.

25
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:32.970
Brian Lerner: I I you know the unknown is definitely daunting, and.

26
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.210
Pranav Manjunath: Brilliant.

27
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.839
Brian Lerner: Yeah, I I think.

28
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:50.700
Brian Lerner: figuring out what you want to study, and the vast sea of knowledge, and trying to make your one contribution and poke that a little bit further. It's intimidating, but it's also exciting, because.

29
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.250
Pranav Manjunath: It's.

30
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.639
Brian Lerner: Honestly doing things that nobody else has ever done in the history of the world. I don't know

31
00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:03.560
Brian Lerner: if anybody has studied traumatic brain injury in the way that we are studying it in the history of the world. And it's pretty exciting, and we

32
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.570
Brian Lerner: things in.

33
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:12.270
Brian Lerner: I think if I think some people like to say, Hmm! That's too hard, or you know

34
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.409
Brian Lerner: you, they're not sure.

35
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.959
Pranav Manjunath: No, no, that's so true. That's so true, I mean.

36
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.489
Pranav Manjunath: And but you know, I think.

37
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.969
Brian Lerner: You know I don't know

38
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:31.919
Brian Lerner: where I'm going with this sentence, except trying to make it hard harder to transcribe. To be honest.

39
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.910
Pranav Manjunath: It's so funny, because, like, I mean, as you said, it's

40
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:43.310
Pranav Manjunath: I mean, we spoke to all these qualitative tutors, and they would, or and also these mentors and everyone that we have on the project, and

41
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.320
Pranav Manjunath: like they haven't seen a size of 21 students working on a project to understand Tbi care.

42
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.130
Pranav Manjunath: and so like.

43
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.339
Pranav Manjunath: Like, we're just like, Oh, this is like fussy.

44
00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:04.970
Pranav Manjunath: We've we are definitely special in this case, like, it's a, it's a team where we have 21 students, highly talented, highly motivated, to help

45
00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.560
Pranav Manjunath: in the process of helping improve Tba care, and so.

46
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:16.670
Pranav Manjunath: Just. It's just amazing the fact that, like we were in this together, it's learning every day new things and doing and being like

47
00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.060
Pranav Manjunath: well, one of the 1st people to actually work on this as a team. I think it's pretty impressive.

48
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:28.089
Brian Lerner: Yeah, yeah, students are pretty pretty great. Yeah, yeah. And

49
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.820
Brian Lerner: we got a great team. And after we are done

50
00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.069
Brian Lerner: this, Irb, and we know how to transcribe. I I think that

51
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.630
Brian Lerner: just really exciting what we can all accomplish in the second half of the the year. It's gonna be awesome.

52
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.809
Pranav Manjunath: It's gonna be. It's gonna be amazing. I agree, I agree. And how many more minutes do we have of this of this week?

53
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.060
Brian Lerner: I got like, I think, 5 seconds, according to my timer.

54
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.490
Pranav Manjunath: And 3, 2, 1.
